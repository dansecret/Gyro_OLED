# Gyro_OLED

The **Gyro_OLED** project integrates a gyroscope sensor with an OLED display to provide real-time visualization of motion data. This system is designed for applications in motion tracking, robotics, and embedded systems, showcasing expertise in sensor integration, real-time data processing, and display control.

## Features
- **Real-Time Visualization**: Displays angular velocity and orientation on an OLED screen.
- **Sensor Integration**: Captures motion data from a gyroscope sensor.
- **Embedded Systems**: Demonstrates efficient microcontroller programming for hardware-software interaction.

## Technologies Used
- **Microcontroller**: [Specify the microcontroller, e.g., Arduino]
- **Programming Language**: C++
- **Hardware**: Gyroscope sensor, OLED display

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dansecret/Gyro_OLED.git
    ```
2. Open the code in your preferred IDE (e.g., Arduino IDE).
3. Upload the code to the microcontroller.
4. Connect the gyroscope sensor and OLED display as per the wiring diagram.

## Usage
- Power on the system to start collecting and displaying motion data.
- Move the gyroscope sensor to observe changes in angular velocity and orientation on the OLED display.
